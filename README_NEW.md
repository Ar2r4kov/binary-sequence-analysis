## 🧠 About

This repository documents the results of a closed-source algorithm designed to detect statistical patterns in binary sequences, derived from real-world event data.  
While the algorithm itself remains confidential, the structure, evaluation, and observed outcomes are fully presented for review.

---

## 📊 Summary

- **52 independent blocks** of binary evaluations
- **+392 cumulative gain**
- Strong positive skew over majority of blocks
- Focused on pattern detection and deviation from randomness
