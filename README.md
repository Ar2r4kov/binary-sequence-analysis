# binary-sequence-analysis

📊 Statistical analysis of binary sequences based on real-world roulette data.  
The algorithm is designed to detect non-random patterns, analyze performance, and evaluate the statistical validity of observed sequences.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `README.md` — this file
- `NOTES.md` — observations, research notes, and conclusions
- `DATA.md` *(optional)* — description of data formats or test sets
- Code files will be added soon

---

## 💡 Features

- Detects potential patterns in binary outcome data
- Evaluates deviation from random expectation
- Supports analysis of large datasets
- Open and extensible for further research

---

## 🧪 Methodology

- Compares observed binary outcomes to expected random behavior
- Uses block grouping and aggregate statistics
- Includes future support for Monte Carlo simulations and hypothesis testing

---

## 🚀 Usage

> ⚠️ Code will be uploaded soon. This section will describe how to run the analysis, visualize data, and interpret results.

---

## 🔬 Ideas for Expansion

- Machine learning integration for pattern prediction
- Web interface for uploading and analyzing sequences
- Visualization tools (graphs, timelines, cluster maps)
