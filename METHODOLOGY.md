# Methodology Overview

This document outlines the conceptual approach used to evaluate patterns in binary sequences derived from real-world data.  
The specific algorithm and implementation details remain confidential and are not part of the public repository.

## üß≠ General Principles

The method is based on the assumption that **purely random binary sequences** (e.g. 0 and 1 outcomes) tend to follow predictable probabilistic behavior over long intervals.  
Any **persistent deviation** from this expected behavior may indicate the presence of structure or bias.

---

## üì¶ Block-Based Structure

The binary sequence is divided into **equal-sized blocks**.  
Each block contains a fixed number of outcomes and produces a **net result**, calculated according to internal logic.

- A **positive value** indicates that the block deviated in a favorable direction
- A **negative value** suggests an unfavorable or losing deviation
- A **zero result** is considered statistically neutral

---

## üìà Performance Evaluation

Rather than evaluating individual events, the method focuses on **aggregate behavior** across blocks:

- The total number of blocks with positive vs negative results
- Magnitude of largest gain or loss
- Presence of long-term upward or downward drift
- Cumulative net outcome over time

This approach allows for **statistical smoothing** and helps identify long-term anomalies or non-randomness.

## üß™ Statistical Assumptions

While no statistical test is included in the public version, the following ideas influence the methodology:

- The Law of Large Numbers
- Noise filtering through aggregation
- Outlier identification
- Hypothesis: real-world sequences may contain subtle, non-obvious structure

## ‚ùó Disclaimer

This is a **closed-method** system.  
The exact algorithmic rules, transformation logic, and calculation mechanisms are not disclosed.

This document serves to illustrate the **statistical framing** and **analytical goals** without revealing implementation.
