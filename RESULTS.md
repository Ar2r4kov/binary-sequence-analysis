# Results Overview

ðŸ“Š This document presents the outcome summary from the analysis of binary sequences based on real-world data.  
Although the internal algorithm is not disclosed, the structure and aggregate results of the evaluation are shown here.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

To detect statistically significant deviations from randomness in a sequence of binary outcomes.  
The results are grouped into logical blocks for evaluation of performance and stability over time.

## ðŸ§  Observations

- **43** out of 52 blocks produced a positive result
- The largest gain was **+29**, the largest loss was **-13**
- Only **9** blocks were negative, most within moderate range
- Overall result suggests a **persistent deviation** from pure randomness
